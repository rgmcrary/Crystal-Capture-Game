## Crystal Capture Game

The object of this game is to match the randomly generated number by selecting a combination of the crystals. The value of each crystal is randomly generated and assigned at the start of each game. The value of each crystal is not revealed to the player. The accumulated total is displayed and the goal is to match the accumulated total to the randomly generated number. Gameplay is similar to the card game Blackjack in that the player's goal is to match the randomly generated number without exceeding that value. At the end of each game, the player is asked if another gameplay is desired and the player can select the play again button without having to refresh the browser. The tallied wins and losses are displayed at the top of the page and continues to tally as long as the browser is not refreshed.

The instructions are contained in an accordian box in the upper left of the game play area.
